## Lab 8

### I. Implement a method that determines the arithmetic average of a list of numbers read from a file ('Resources\Lab 08\Numbers'), removes the numbers that are less than the average and saves them in a separate file.

### II. Implement a method that figures out how many characters appear in a string. Example:
- Input
```
Distinctas excoluisse an ex in manifestum ha designabam. Ii is inferri intueri et equidem et corpora veteris. Habituros im ut somniorum ex de albedinem. Homo agam ob spem ab idem. Notionibus persuadere ex co supponatur ii sequeretur alloquendo. Tam jam caeteri delusum pugnare timenda. Eae suo majora passim iisdem hoc.
```
- Output
```
a: 24
b: 6
c: 6
...
```

### III. Implement a small project that simulates a repairer service. 
The service should check the components of a customers' rig and display them in chronological order from oldest to newest.
After identifying the outdated components (2017 or older), we should replace using spare parts that we own.
After replacing the components, we should display the updated rig to the customer and present the final bill (based on the replaced components).
