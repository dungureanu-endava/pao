## Lab 3

### I. Implement a small project that simulates a Mini Zoo where people go to play with different animals.

### The Mini Zoo will have between 3 to 5 animals.

### When people visit the Zoo, they will first pick the animal that they want to play with.

### Each animal will react differently to the way that people interact with them (ex. Lions will *growl* when *scared*).
