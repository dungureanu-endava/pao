### Note: You can start the project with just 3 or 4 cocktails.

### Phase 1
At the end of the program (after all customers have placed their orders) you would like to know how much money you made.
Display the income for that day.

### Phase 2
Considering that you have two bottles (of 750 ml) of each liquor type (White Rum/Gin/Vodka/...) in stock, 
let a customer know when you don't have ingredients for mixing a cocktail and don't take his money.

### Phase 3
When you don't have ingredients for a cocktail, suggest a list of cocktails that are available.

### Phase 4
At the end of the day, if you have less than one bottle (750 ml) for a liquor type, place an order for it.
