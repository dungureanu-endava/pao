## Lab 7

### I. Implement a small project that simulates a file search engine. 
The search will be triggered by a user provided input and will be realised in the 'Resources\Lab 07\Search' folder. 
The result of the search will display the files where the word was found and how many times it appears in that file.

### II. Implement a small project that simulates an invoice process.
Process all purchase orders files from the 'Resources\Lab 07\Invoice' folder. 
- File Name Format: Purchase Order ~DATE~.csv
- File Content Format:
```
Make, Model, Count, Price
Item 1 Make, Item 1 Model, Item 1 Count, Item 1 Price
Item 2 Make, Item 2 Model, Item 2 Count, Item 2 Price
Item 3 Make, Item 3 Model, Item 3 Count, Item 3 Price
Item 4 Make, Item 4 Model, Item 4 Count, Item 4 Price
```

At the end of the process, display invoice for each purchase order (items bought and total price for that purchase order) and the overall cost for all items.
